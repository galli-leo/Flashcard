// This file contains only the questions that I really need to learn by heart because they aren't obvious in any way
Number of genes in humans
2.5 * 10^4 (i.e. 25'000)
Number of base pairs in human DNA
3 * 10^9 (i.e. Three Billion)
Average synapse count per neuron
10^4
Average input count needed for a neuron to fire
25
Human brain weight
1.5 kg
Human brain volume
1.1 liters
Human brain neuron count
86 billion (approx. 10^11)
Human brain synapse count
approx 10^15
Human brain synapse count =
[synapse count per neuron]*[#neurons]|
10^4 * 10^11 = 10^15
Human brain mass percentage of whole body mass
2%
Human brain energy consumption of whole body's
20%
